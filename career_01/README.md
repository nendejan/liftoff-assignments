
Attend a Meetup Assignment:


1 - Get to the HEART of UX
    12/19/17
    5:30PM
    UX/Google Heart Framework
  
2 - This meetup was centered around Google's HEART UX Framework used for measuring UX quality. A speech was given by a product designer at 
    Monsanto named Justin Ranton. The HEART frame work revolves around using 5 metrics to measure the quality of a web page or application's
    ability to effectively and enjoyably interact with a user. HEART is an acronym for; Happiness, Engagement, Adoption, Retention, Task Success.
    
3 -  I find user design very interesting, it doesn't matter how great of a programmer you are, if the interface with the user isn't intuitive
    and friendly, the application will eventually be discarded for one that is. Where can I learn more about this topic? What kinds of jobs
    are there that specifically deal with UX and design?
    
4 - After attending the meetup I realized that interest in effective and enjoyable design is a pretty widespread and important topic. This
    Meetup group, STLX, is focused around bringing people with a passion for it together to learn and share ideas and I am excited to go
    to their next event.
